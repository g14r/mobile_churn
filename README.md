# Mobile churn
Final group project for the datascience bootcamp

>A bit of **background**: in the digital marketing world it is really important to retain the customers (not to let them *churn* / unsubscribe). Most big companies have churn prediction models which are based on customer data. Attached is a dataset for a mobile company in which different features of each customer are shown (in different columns), and in the last column you can see if they churned or not.

The focus of the project is to build a churn predictive model. Here, are the major steps you should take: 
1. Familiarize yourself with data: some data exploration and visualization
2. Data pre-processing: remember that machine learning algorithms only understand numbers and not words. Many features in this dataset are not numbers and you need to change them to numbers! 
3. Split the data to train and test and build your model based on the training and evaluate it on the test set. You can use any model that you like!
